        <h4 translate>How accurate is this data?</h4>
        <p translate>
            Since the launch of the Taken King, we have aggregated data from every single match played. Our rankings
            are updated in real-time and immediately available. If you have played Destiny recently, particularly in the
            Crucible, you have a profile here - check it out!

        <h4 translate>What is "Elo" and what does it mean?</h4>
        <p translate>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
        <blockquote translate>
            The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in
            competitor-versus-competitor games.
        </blockquote>
        <p translate>
            All players start at a baseline of 1200 points. You will take points from your opponent's Elo score by
            defeating them, and vise versa. Defeating a more skilled opponent will yield higher points than if you beat up
            on a weaker one. The higher the score, the more skilled the player. It is extremely difficult
            to maintain a high Elo score, these players are regarded as the best of the best!
        </p>

        <p translate>
            As your score rises and falls, you'll be categorized into leagues.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li translate>Bronze: 0-1099</li>
            <li translate>Silver: 1100-1299</li>
            <li translate>Gold: 1300-1499</li>
            <li translate>Platinum: 1500-1699</li>
            <li translate>Diamond: 1700+</li>
        </ul>

        <p translate>
            Each mode you play has its own Elo rating and league categorization. Beyond that, Elo is account-wide, so in
            Control you'll have the same rating whether you're on your Titan, Warlock or Hunter.

        <h4>What happened to the global weapon usage stats?</h4>
        <p translate>
            Our global weapon stats are undergoing a revamp. We had to go back to the drawing board with a recent site
            overhaul. It will be coming back better than ever, but we don't have a timeline at this moment.
