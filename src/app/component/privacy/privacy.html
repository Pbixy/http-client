    <p>Last updated: March 31st, 2016</p>

    <p>GUARDIAN.GG ("us", "we", or "our") operates http://guardian.gg (the "Site"). This page informs you of our
        policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.</p>

    <p>We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the
        collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h4>Information Collection And Use</h4>

    <p>While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information
    that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not
    limited to your name ("Personal Information").</p>

    <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use
        aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits
        to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
        If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
        information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Log Data</h4>

    <p>Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data").</p>

    <p>This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
    browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit,
    the time spent on those pages and other statistics.</p>

    <p>In addition, we use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>

    <p>We use cookies to store information for your convenience ("Settings"). We also may use third party advertisements
        on the Site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise
        on the Site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)
        information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases,
        whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real
        estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited
        (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

    <p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings,
        or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can greatly affect how
        you are able to interact with the Site as well as most other websites.</p>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to
    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
    absolute security.</p>

    <h4>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this
    Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the
    Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your
    consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
