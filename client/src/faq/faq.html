                The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in
                competitor-versus-competitor games.

                All players start at a baseline of 1200 points. You will take points from your opponent's Elo score by
                defeating them, and vice versa. Defeating a more skilled team will yield higher points than if you beat
                up on a weaker one. The higher the score, the more skilled the player. It is extremely difficult
                to maintain a high Elo score, these players are regarded as the best of the best!

                As your score rises and falls, you'll be placed into leagues.

                Each mode you play has its own Elo rating and league categorization. Beyond that, Elo is account-wide,
                so in Control you'll have the same rating whether you're on your Titan, Warlock or Hunter.
